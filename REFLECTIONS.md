## Key Learnings
the learinings that i made during the whole project are how to optimise some of the prompts to ai agents like for some places i definitely thought that if i wrote the prompt better the agent would be able to provide me with correct outputs that i actually need
I need to teach the agents everything for a better resourcefull output that is actually helpfull 
sometimes ai gets stuck on a loop at that moment you can find the error yourself or indulge in a new ai for different outputs or it is better to resolve the error yourself

## Efficiency gains vs manual coding
yes there was efficiency i would not be able to write this much code on the span of just 2 days so ai coding is definitely faster but less reliable if the person does not have any knowledge

## Improvements you’d make next time
next time I would definitely connect the backend to the frontend  with seeding the data in the postgres server to test the outputs and definitely be able to use the created backend fully with completing it without any errors
